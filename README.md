# Multi-Article-Summarization-and-Visualization

Project Overview:
The News Aggregator Website is a platform that brings together news articles from various sources and provides users with automated 30â€“40-word text summaries, image generation, and text-to-speech translation features. This project aims to make news consumption more efficient and accessible.

Key features of this project include:

Automated Summaries: We employ extraction-based summarization techniques to generate concise summaries of news articles. Our "Frequency Driven approach" based on word weights helps prioritize essential content, ensuring informative summaries.

Image Generation: To enhance the user experience, we generate images related to news articles. These images are sourced by extracting top-ranking keywords from Google Images, adding visual context to the news stories.

Text-to-Speech Translation: Accessibility is a priority in our project. We've integrated Google Translate for text-to-speech translation, allowing users to listen to news articles in multiple languages.
